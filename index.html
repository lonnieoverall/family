    <h1>How many F's are their in your family?</h1>
    <p>I heard a story of a country musician who lives his life by the simple principal he calls the 3 F's</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Faith</li>
        <li>Family</li>
        <li>Fan's</li>
    </ul>
    <p>He bases all he does on those three factors, or principles. When presented with a choice or decision he simply asks himself if the decision lines up with these principles. When they don't line up he walks away. Sounds simple and intriguing don't you think?</p>
    <p>What would the F's be for you and your family? For me I think they would be:
        <ul>
            <li>Faith - We are Jesus folowers and we behave as such.</li>
            <li>Family - We are a family and we spend time together.</li>
            <li>Fun - We do fun things together.</li>
            <li>Friends - We surround ourselves with like minded people.</li>
            <li>Fitness - We go outside and do things that make us sweat.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
